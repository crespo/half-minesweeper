# half-minesweeper
This game was the first game I made, back in 2018, when I was taking C classes. It's based on procedural programming.

## Info
It takes notes of how many bombs are on the board, displays the full updated grid of the game board every turn played, every game is a different setup of bombs (made with real random generated numbers) and shows (like a minesweeper game should do) how many bombs are around the position you chose.

My mainly difficulty in this project was to count the bombs around the position players chose, when the position is at any border of the grid.

## Testing it
1. Open [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler). It's an online C/C++ compiler and debugger.
1. Copy the [game.c](https://github.com/crespo/half-minesweeper/blob/master/game.c) code and paste it at the OnlineGDB editor
1. Click on 'Run' that's sitting at the top of the browser.
1. Try your luck playing it!
